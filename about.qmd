I am a junior here at Penn studying Economic Histiry with a strong interest in Finance and Entrepreneurship. I live in Fairfield, CT, but am originally from Vail, CO. Outside of the classroom, I am a member of the Varsity Men's Lacrosse Team and Finance Club.These blogs are about my explorations with AIs. Additionally, I will write about recent AI news from time to time.
